# 🌱 Empowering Phrases App

Welcome! This is a simple, responsive web app where you can create, read, update, and delete empowering phrases—each one tied to an author, and optionally, an image. It's built with **React.js** and follows the **Atomic Design** methodology to keep everything clean, scalable, and modular.

Whether you're a developer checking out the code or just curious to see how a collaborative CRUD app works, you're in the right place.

## 📐 Project Structure & Design

We followed a **component-based architecture** using **Atomic Design** principles: breaking down the UI into atoms, molecules, organisms, and so on.

Our goal was to keep components **reusable**, **responsive**, and easy to maintain.

We worked in two **sprints**, each with planning, development, and review phases.

We used:

* **Trello** to organize our tasks and keep track of progress
* **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration
* **Daily stand-ups** to communicate and adjust priorities
* **Figma** for visual design and wireframes
